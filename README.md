# HTML-CSS-JS Widgets

This repository contains a collection of ready-to-use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** code snippets and widgets that can be easily embedded into any website — including platforms like **Google Sites**, **personal websites**, **static web pages**, or **CMS-based sites**.

These widgets are lightweight, self-contained, and require no external libraries or hosting. Perfect for enhancing websites with interactivity and style, even when platform limitations exist.

## 🚀 How to Use
